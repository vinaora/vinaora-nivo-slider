Responsive Slideshow
--------------------

Responsive web design (often abbreviated to RWD) is an approach to web design in which a site is crafted to provide an optimal viewing experience - easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling - across a wide range of devices (from desktop computer monitors to mobile phones)

[Vinaora Nivo Slider](http://vinaora.com/vinaora-nivo-slider/) can now handle images of any size and will fill the container width. The slider height is variable and changes depending on the image height. Fixed size sliders can still be created, all you need to do is make sure your images are all the same size and set the width and height attributes of your slider

*Note: As of v2.5.25 the slider is responsive by default. If you want a fixed size slider, please make sure all of your images are the same size.*

FAQs
----
* Does the slider support transparent PNG’s?
No. Due to the way slide transitions work it will look weird.
* Can I use images that are different sizes?
As of v2.5.25 or later, yes you can. The slider is now responsive and can handle images of any size.
* Can I have multiple sliders on the same page?
Yes but you will need to load jQuery v1.7 or greater for it to work.
